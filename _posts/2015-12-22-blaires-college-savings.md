If you're considering a gift for Blaire in the future, I'd like to invite you to consider using Ugift. It's an easy, free-to-use service that makes it easy to contribute to our 529 college savings plan account at any time.   
There are no fees with Ugift; your entire gift will go to Blaire's 529 account. You can make a secure gift contribution for special events (birthdays, holidays) or any time you'd like. All you need is the following Ugift code, which can be used until Blaire is out of college.   
To make a gift contribution using Ugift: 

* Go to Ugift529.com.  
* Enter the Ugift code: O3R-99Z.

* Enter your name and the amount of your gift.
